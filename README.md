# Introduction
Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, and creating features from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning models. This program offers a collection of feature engineering techniques, including:

# Feature Selection: Methods for choosing the most relevant features to improve model efficiency and interpretability.

# Feature Scaling: Techniques to normalize or standardize features, ensuring they have similar scales.

# Feature Extraction: Algorithms to extract relevant information from unstructured data, such as text or images.

# Feature Creation: Tools for generating new features based on domain knowledge or data relationships.

# Handling Missing Data: Strategies to deal with missing values, such as imputation or removal.

# Encoding Categorical Variables: Methods to convert categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for modeling.
